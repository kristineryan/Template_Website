<h2>Greetings!</h2>

<p>My name is Kris and I am a graduate student in the Scientific and Technical Communication certificate program. I work for a healthcare organization in Rochester, MN.</p>
<p>When the Minnesota climate permits, I enjoy hiking, biking, and golf. Wintertime means snow-shoeing, game nights, and travel to warm places when I can get away.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I majored in English and minored in Management Information Systems at Augsburg College.</p>
<p>In the Lynda.com tutorial, "HTML Essential Training," I will soon start the CSS section. I'm excited to learn how to use CSS to <strong><i>style</i></strong> my webpage!</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I will use an unordered list to describe some work-related goals:
  <ul>
  <li>Writing well&mdash;digitally and otherwise</li>
  <li>Learning more about how to improve our users' web experience</li>
  <li>Gaining project management skills</li>
</ul></p>
